# Music Garden
This is a music management tool for music database that contains 3 tables: songs, artists and albums.

It offers users a various of ways to 1) diaplay detailed music information 2) import music entities into database 3) automatically fill in the missing details of music entities using AudioDB(for artist and album) and MusicBranz(for song) 4) genetate and manage the playlist in different ways.

While it is running, some data in the database will be dynamically updated if any change happens, such as the "nSongs" and the "nAlbums" in the table "artists" and the "nSongs" in the table "albums".

It could be run in both IntelliJ and Terminal(ex. run the Jar file created by Maven).

Tips: Use Maven to create jar for the first time?
1) Since there are 2 external packages(i.e. "json-simple-1.1.1.jar" and "sqlite-jdbc-3.36.0.3.jar") that we will use in this project, we need to copy the "lib" folder in the out/artifacts/CS514_Homework7_BingLiang_jar directory that contains those 2 external packages and paste it into the target directory after the install.
2) We need to put the .db file(i.e. "music.db" for this project) that has at least three tables(songs, artists and albums) into the target directory.
